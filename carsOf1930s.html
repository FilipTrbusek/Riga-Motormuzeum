            six-cylinder engine. It remained in production for slightly under two years before being replaced by the Audi Front UW
            225 featuring a larger 2.25-litre engine. The larger-engined car introduced in 1935 was built till April 1938 and
            continued to be listed into 1939. Between 1933 and 1938, the Front was the only Audi in volume production.</p>

            <p class="lead">At launch the Front UW 220 featured a straight-six-cylinder ohv engine of 1,950 cc. Claimed maximum power output was 40
            PS (29 kW; 39 hp) at 3,500 rpm. The two-litre engine was shared with the Auto Union group’s Wanderer W22 introduced at
            the same time. The letters "UW" in the car's name stood for "Umgekehrter Wanderer" and referred to the fact that it
            featured a Wanderer engine that had been "umgekehrt" (turned around) through 180 degrees in order to drive wheels which,
            on this application, were actually ahead of the engine.</p>
            <p class="lead">In common with many performance cars of the period, the Front UW 220 provided a claimed top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph):
            presumably actual performance data would have varied according to the weight and wind-cheating qualities of each
            individual car body. Various body styles were offered, including four-door sports limousines and two-door cabriolets /
            roadsters.</p>
            <p class="lead">For the UW 225 produced from 1935, engine size was increased to 2,257 cc, and reported maximum power rose to 50 PS (37
            kW; 49 hp) or 55 PS (40 kW; 54 hp), respectively at 3,300 or 3,800 rpm: increased power was reflected by a modest
            increase in the claimed top speed to 105 km/h (65 mph). The ohv engine came, again, from fellow Auto Union group
            member Wanderer, being shared with the Wanderer W245 and its successors.
            
            Despite the relative novelty of the front-wheel-drive configuration, the manufacturer quoted the car's turning circle as
            12.5 metres (41 ft) which was not greatly above the norm for cars of this size. The rear-wheel-drive Wanderer with which
            the Audi shared its engine featured an advertised turning circle of 12 meters.</p>
            <p class="lead">Approximately 4,500 Audi Fronts were produced, including 1,817 of the earlier UW 220 model built between April 1933 and
            November 1934. By 1938 2,591 of the successor UW 225 model had been produced.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Packard Motor Company relied on making luxurious cars that were highly refined, fitted with luxurious coachwork, and
            powered by proven engineering. This belief had placed them among the elite in the auto industry during the early 1900s.
            As the world entered the Great Depression, the Packard Company was one of the few that managed to survive. In fact, they
            outsold all of their competitors combined.</p>

            <p class="lead">They had entered the Depression in excellent financial health and they
            emerged with strong financial footing. But the post depression era had them worried, as the number of potential buyers
            had dwindled as fortunes were lost. Production had dropped nearly half each year when compared with the previous, from
            1929 to 1933. In response to the decline, Packard continued to make improvements each year.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1932, Packard introduced their Ninth Series. It featured many improvements which helped segregate it from other
            automakers in the industry. Improvements included a revised steering geometry which made steering smooth and easy.
            Braking was equally as easy thanks to the new driver adjustable power assisted braking system. The shifting action and
            clutch were improved making driving a very enjoyable activity. The drivers workload was eased even further with the
            spark advance and automatic choke. By making these changes they attracted a growing segment of buyers and drivers - woman.</p>
            <p class="lead">The 1933 Packard's were called the Tenth Series cars as the company still refused to adopt the convention of the model
            year system which called for new cars to be introduced in September or October to coincide with the auto show schedules.
            The following year, the reluctantly joined with other manufacturers which resulted in a shorted run for the tenth
            series, lasting just seven months. The new Packard model line was introduced in the fall. Because of the seven month
            production lifespan of the Tenth Series, very few were produced making them very rare in modern times.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Tenth Series were given a new X-braced frames, dual coil ignition, and downdraft carburetors. The styling was
            updated with skirted fenders and a 'V'-shaped radiator shell. The interior featured upgraded trim and a new aircraft
            inspired dash.</p>
            <p class="lead">Packard continued to offer three chassis, the Eight, Super Eight, and the Twelve. The Super Eight and Twelve both rested
            on a wheelbase that measured 142-inches and had a hood that was nearly six-inches longer than the Eight. The fenders
            were longer as well.</p>
            <p class="lead"></p>
            <p class="lead">In 1936 Packard was producing their Fourteenth Series as the number thirteen had been skipped. It is believed that
            thirteen was not used due to superstitious reasons. The Fourteenth Series was the last year for Bijur lubrication, ride
            control, a semi-elliptic suspension, mechanical brakes, heavy vibration dampening bumpers and the 384.4 cubic inch
            straight eight engine. It was also the last year for the option of wire or wood wheels.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1936 the fourteenth series received a new radiator which was installed at a five-degree angle. The Super 8 had a new
            sloped grille with chrome vertical bars which gave the vehicle a unique look and served as thermostatically controlled
            shutters which opened or closed based on engine heat. The headlight trim, fender styling, and hood vents saw minor
            changes. A new Delco-Remy ignition system was the new updates for 1936 under the bonnet.</p>
            <p class="lead">For 1936 there were a total of 1,492 Super Eights constructed.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <p class="lead">Much of the car’s production period coincided with the Great Patriotic War (World War II), and many, as they were
            commonly called, Emkas were used by the army as staff cars. Various special versions were produced such as the Gaz M -
            FAI and BA-20 armoured car models.</p>
            <p class="lead">The car has subsequently become an icon of its time in Russia, having been relatively popular, and featuring in film and
            photographic images of a defining period in the history of the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Soviet Union’s first passenger car had been the GAZ-A, produced between 1932 and 1936, and based on the Ford Model A
            (1927–31), built under license/technology sharing agreement with and using parts purchased from the American Ford Motor
            Company. It would be many years before passenger cars became available for private buyers in the Soviet Union, and
            passenger cars at this stage were produced for official and military use. By the time the GAZ-A was being produced in
            the Soviet Union, the western original Ford Model A was already becoming superseded in its western markets, and the
            politicians and Red army looked for a way to reduce dependence on imported components and replacement parts. The version
            of the Ford adapted for Soviet production was an open topped car which was unsuitable for the winter climate encountered
            in most of the country, and the cars were felt to be unreliable and insufficiently robust for the relatively harsh
            Russian conditions.</p>
            <p class="lead">There had therefore been various attempts to modify the GAZ-A using locally designed elements, but the body structures
            in question had used traditional timber frames with panels attached, which were labour-intensive to produce and
            excessively prone to deform. In the US car body construction was changing radically during the later 1920s, using
            technology pioneered by Ambi Budd, for the production of all steel car bodies. The new approach used far more
            complicated steel pressings than had hitherto been possible, and the same new techniques were adopted by the more
            prosperous of the volume auto-makers in the west of Europe through the 1930s. GAZ’s western technology partner, Ford,
            took a conservative approach to these developments, but during the early 1930s they, too, would join in the switch to
            all-steel car bodies.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Soviet Union was keen for the same technology to be applied at the GAZ plant in Gorky, exploiting the ten-year
            technology sharing agreement which had been signed with the Ford Motor Company in 1932, and which at this stage remained
            more or less intact.</p>
            <p class="lead">Work began in 1933/34 on a replacement for the GAZ-A, again using a (newer) Ford model as the basis. The model in
            question was the Ford Model B, which was becoming available with a wide range of different bodies in North America.</p>
            <p class="lead">Specifically, the first prototype for the GAZ M-1 was based on the 1934 Ford Model B 40A four-door sedan. The prototype
            was powered by a four-cylinder engine, although it appears already to have been intended that production cars, like the
            Ford on which they were based, would use V8 units. Documentation was transferred by Ford in accordance with the terms of
            the technology sharing agreement and the first prototype was unveiled in February 1935. A major innovation for the
            manufacturer was the all-steel body, although at this stage the roof was still reinforced using timber side rails and
            was coated with synthetic “leatherette” fabric.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1936 the M-1 replaced the GAZ-A on the manufacturer’s production lines, with the first two cars produced in March of
            that year and volume production starting in May. By the end of 1936 the plant had produced 2,524 GAZ M-1s, and in 1937
            an M-1 was displayed in Paris at the International Artistic and technical exhibition of modern life. The letter ”M” was
            included in the car’s name as the plant's name included that of Vyacheslav Molotov.</p>
