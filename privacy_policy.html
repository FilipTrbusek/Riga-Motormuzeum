                provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform that contract. In that case, we may have to stop
                providing a service to you. If so, we will notify you of this at the time.</p>
                <h5 class="font-weight-bold text-secondary mt-5 mb-4">The bases on which we process information about you</h5>
                <p>The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal
                  information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.</p>
                <p>If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop
                  processing
                  your data.</p>
                <p>If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we

                  determined that we can continue to process your information.</p>
                <p>When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and
                conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.</p>
                <p>In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of this
                information may be personal information.</p>
                <p>We may use it in order to:</p>
            <ul class="mb-4">
              <li>verify your identity for security purposes</li>
              <li>sell products to you</li>
              <li>provide you with our services</li>
              <li>provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website
              </li>
            </ul>
                <p>We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the
                information before we enter into a legal contract.</p>
                <p>We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under

                  <p>Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our
                  website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including [job opportunities and] our products and
                  services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.</p>
                  <p>Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to
                  agree to our use of cookies.</p>
                  <p>If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from time to time pass your name and contact information to
                  selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful.</p>
                  <p>We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed
                  that your consent no longer exists.</p>
                  <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us [at email address or webpage]. However, if you do so, you
                  may not be able to use our website or our services further.</p>
              <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests</li>
                  <p>We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.</p>
                  <p>Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:</p>
            <ul class="mb-3">
              <li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</li>
              <li>whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</li>
              <li>whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to
                do so</li>
            </ul>
                  <p>For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our [organisational or business]</li>
              <li>responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response</li>
              <li>protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party</li>
              <li>insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage [organisational or business] risk</li>
              <li>protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so</li>
            </ul>
              <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Information we process because we have a legal obligation</li>
                  <p>Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.</p>
                  <p>For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper
                  authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.</p>
                  <p>This may include your personal information.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.</p>

                  <p>Our website is a publishing medium. Anyone may register and then publish information about himself, herself or some

                  may use technology that automatically collects information about you when their advertisement is displayed on our

                <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Credit reference</li>
                  <p>To assist in combating fraud, we share information with credit reference agencies, so far as it relates to clients or
                  customers who instruct their credit card issuer to cancel payment to us without having first provided an acceptable
                  reason to us and given us the opportunity to refund their money.</p>
                <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Data may be processed outside the European Union</li>
                  <p>Our websites are hosted in [country].</p>

                  business.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly data obtained within the UK or any other country could be processed outside the European Union.</p>
                  <p>For example, some of the software our website uses may have been developed in the United States of America or in

                <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Access to your personal information</li>
                  <p>At any time you may review or update personally identifiable information that we hold about you, by signing in to your

                  <p>If you wish us to remove personally identifiable information from our website, you should contact us to make your
                  request.</p>
                  <p>This may limit the service we can provide to you.</p>
                <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Verification of your information</li>
                  <p>When we receive any request to access, edit or delete personal identifiable information we shall first take reasonable
                  steps to verify your identity before granting you access or otherwise taking any action. This is important to safeguard
                  your information.</p>

                  <p>We collect data about all users of and visitors to these areas regardless of age, and we anticipate that some of those
                  users and visitors will be children.</p>
                  <p>Such child users and visitors will inevitably visit other parts of the site and will be subject to whatever on-site
                  marketing they find, wherever they visit.</p>
                <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Encryption of data sent between us</li>
                  <p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to verify our identity to your browser and to encrypt any data you give
                  us.</p>
                  <p>Whenever information is transferred between us, you can check that it is done so using SSL by looking for a closed
                  padlock symbol or other trust mark in your browser’s URL bar or toolbar.</p>
                <li class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">How you can complain</li>
                  <p>If you are not happy with our privacy policy or if you have any complaint then you should tell us.</p>
                  <p>[You can find further information about our complaint handling procedure at webpage URL]</p>
                  <p>If a dispute is not settled then we hope you will agree to attempt to resolve it by engaging in good faith with us in a
                  process of mediation or arbitration.</p>
                  <p>If you are in any way dissatisfied about how we process your personal information, you have a right to lodge a complaint
                  with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This can be done at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/">https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/</a>. We would,
