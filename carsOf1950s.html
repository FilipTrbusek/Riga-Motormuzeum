            <p class="lead">The body style was in the American tradition of the time and resembled the mid-1950s cars built by Packard, although,
            apart from being in tune with current trends, it was an original design and had nothing in common with them, except in
            general layout.</p>
            <p class="lead">The interiors were trimmed with top quality leather and broadcloth and decorated with thick pile carpet and polished
            wooden fittings. It featured a comprehensive ventilation and heating system and a 5-band radio, all of which could
            be controlled from the rear, electric windows, vacuum-operated screen wash, windshield and front door window
            defrosting. It was powered by a 6.0 L V8 engine producing 200 hp connected to an automatic transmission (similar
            to that of Chrysler's PowerFlite and influenced by it, but different in design) giving a top speed of 170 km/h
            (106 mph), hydraulic drum brakes with a vacuum servo booster, coil and wishbone IFS.</p>
            <p class="lead">The car won a top prize at the Brussels Expo World Fair in 1958.</p>
            <p class="lead">Apart from a basic version ZiL-111, the manufacturer produced ZiL-111A with air conditioning, which had a smaller and
            flatter rear window due to air tubes, and convertible ZiL-111V (ЗиЛ-111В in Russian, only 12 built). The convertible
            based on the ZiL-111 was dubbed ZiL-111V.</p>
            <p class="lead">In December 1962 the car was completely restyled, now being in tune with the latest trends and having a wide chrome
            grille with quad headlamps similar to the one used on the 1961 Cadillac Fleetwood Seventy-Five, and was available
            both as sedan ZiL-111G and convertible ZiL-111D. It was fitted with a 200 hp 5,980 cc (365 cu in) V8. For U.S.
            President Dwight D. Eisenhower's visit, Yevgeny Molchanov designed a special version of this car. Air conditioning was
            standard.</p>
            <p class="lead">The ZiL-111G went out of production in 1966. The first ZiL-111D was built in 1963, six months after the new ZiL-111
            appeared, only about eight were built, half with grey exteriors, and all were fitted with microphones. Fidel Castro
            received a ZiL-111D as a gift.</p>
            <p class="lead">As a rule, the ZiL-111 was available only as state-owned transport for members of the Politburo. In 1958-1967 112 of
            all models were made, of them 26 ZiL-111Gs.</p>
            <p class="lead">A minibus based on the ZIL-111, the ZIL-118 Yunost (Youth), was also developed and produced in small numbers.</p>
            <p class="lead">The ZiL-111 would be replaced in 1967 by the ZIL-114.</p>

            <p class="lead">They were specially designed for disabled drivers and were distributed in the USSR free or at a large
            discount through the Soviet Union's social welfare system, and were not officially sold to non-disabled people.</p>
            <p class="lead">The S-3A-M was produced between 1958 and 1970. It was powered by a 346 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine, giving 10
            hp (7 kW) and a top speed of 55 km/h (34 mph).</p>
            <p class="lead">The S-3D, produced between 1970 and 1997, was a twin-seat, four-wheeled cyclecar, 2.6 metres (102.4 in) in length, but
            rather heavy (≈500 kg) due to all-steel body. It was powered by IZH-P3 air-cooled two-stroke engine (18 DIN hp).</p>
            <p class="lead">In the USSR the model was commonly known as a "motor-wheelchair" (Russian: инвалидка, invalidka) because they were only
            leased via social care system to disabled people for five years without permission to sell (in a similar way to the
            British Invacars, made by AC, Thundersley and Tippen). After five years of use, a lessee had to return his
            "motor-wheelchair" to the social care organisations, and was given a new one.</p>
            <p class="lead">However, unlike the Invacars, not all of the "invalidkas" were scrapped, because some of their disabled lessees managed
            to register them as their private property. However, nowadays they are rare, and earlier models are exceptionally rare
            and have become collectors' items.</p>
            <p class="lead">Since the 1980s the use of SMZ cars has been in decline because disabled drivers prefer to use conventional cars with
            modified controls: Zaporozhets models, for instance, or the later VAZ-1111 "Oka", which were sold to them at substantial
            discounts. Nevertheless, the last 300 S-3Ds left the SeAZ factory as late as autumn 1997.</p>
            <p class="lead">S-3D production was discontinued without a direct replacement. The VAZ-1111 "Oka", which filled this role later, was a
            much larger, four-seater car.</p>

            built under licence from Fiat and was based on the Fiat 500. In 1954 it was decided at Steyr-Puch to resume car production after the war.</p>

            <p class="lead">Because of the high costs associated with
            the development of a completely new design, an agreement was made with Fiat to acquire and adapt the body in white of
            their Nuova 500 (Italian: Cinquecento) model designed by Dante Giacosa. Of the body, only the engine cover and later the
            roof was produced in-house. On the other hand, engine, transmission and carriage were all manufactured by Steyr-Puch.
            The engine was a two-cylinder (16 hp/12 kW) flat engine which proved to be far more smooth-running than the
            straight-twin engine used by Fiat. It brought good driving behaviour for its time, especially in mountain rides. The
            Italians too had experimented mounting this engine to their car originally, but it was dropped in favor of the simpler
            in-line twin.</p>
            <p class="lead">The first Steyr-Puch 500 Modell Fiat was launched in 1957 and sold well. At first it was offered with a folding roof
            only, and it was expected to draw in motorcyclists as a buying audience. The Puchwagen or Pucherl, as it was called, was
            the official car for the Austrian AA-service.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1959 came the first revision. The model Steyr-Puch 500 D was provided with the metal roof produced by Fiat (D for
            Dach, i.e. "roof" in German), and in addition to that the luxury model 500 DL was equipped with a stronger engine (20
            hp/15 kW). 1961 saw the launch of two estate models, 700 C (C for Combi) and 700 E (E for Economy), both featuring a
            larger 643 cc engine but with different power ratings. In 1962 the sedan, too, was equipped with the larger engine,
            leading to the 650 T (T for Thondorf, the location of the manufacturing plant in Graz).</p>
            <p class="lead">A few years later the engine was boosted even more, resulting in the models 650 TR and 650 TR II (R for Rallye) – models
            at first intended for police use, but later also offered as standard. Going through homologation in the Group 2 racing
            class, they successfully participated in motorsport events, competing with its Abarth sister models. In 1966 the Polish
            driver Sobiesław Zasada won the European Rally Championship with a Steyr-Puch 650 TR II, the smallest vehicle ever to
            achieve such victory. Gerard van Lennep won the Production Cars Championship (up to 700 cc.) of the Netherlands in 1966
            and 1967 with a yellow 650 TR. He also competed in European Cup races, winning in Belgrade.</p>
            <p class="lead">The body and outfit had remained more or less the same, until in 1967 the modified Fiat 500 design introduced in 1965
            was adopted in Graz. The most essential new feature were the front hinged doors as opposed to the former suicide doors.
            At the same time, the roof was adopted from Fiat. The new models were given the additional label "Europa". In 1969, due
            to decreasing demand, it was decided to adopt not only the body but the complete drivetrain minus engine from Fiat. The
            engine was the only unit remaining under local manufacture and the model was now called 500 S (Sport).</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1960, 20-year-old recent design school graduate Werner Hölbl designed a handsome italianate coupé bodywork for the
            Puch 500. It is referred to as the Steyr Puch 500 D Adria TS, the Puch Adria TS, or also Steyr-Puch 700 Sport-Coupé. One
            example was presented to Gianni Agnelli who was visiting Austria, as series production was hoped for, but it never
            materialized and only 18 examples were built.[1] The cars built were finished mostly by hand in Hölbl's father's
            bodyshop - the first few cars in Klagenfurt but most of them after a move to Vienna. To improve the proportions of the
            car, the longer chassis of the 700 C estate. It was also equipped with the larger engine (called a "700"), but tuned to
            28 PS (21 kW), and there was also a Super Sport model with 32 PS (24 kW) listed in a period advertisement.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1973, Fiat's successor model, the 126, was adopted in Graz. Here, too, Puch restricted themselves essentially to
            fitting a Puch flat engine in the otherwise nearly finished car. As early as 1975, production was stopped due to
            diminishing demand.</p>
            <p class="lead">The small car sold well, with around 60,000 units produced between 1957 and 1975. Despite restrictive licensing terms
            from Fiat, quite a few cars were distributed outside Austria, most of them in Germany and Hungary, as well as in
            Finland, imported by Sisu Auto.</p>
