            <p class="lead">Design work started in 1959, and the first prototype appeared in March 1961. The first production 408 was built 1
            August 1964, and the 408 was given its official debut on October 21. First marketed body styles of the main version
            were a four-door saloon (base), five-door estate (the model M-426, an upgrade of second generation M-423 and M-424), and
            a three-door sedan delivery (the M-433, an upgrade of the second generation M-432 delivery pick-up).</p>
            <p class="lead">The IZh-408 was a duplicate version of the car made by IZh factory in Izhevsk from 1966 to 1967. It was then replaced in
            production by the M-412.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1976, alongside the M-412, the series were succeeded by the third generation M-2140 series.</p>
            <p class="lead">There were two distinct series of the M-408, which both used the same name. On 20 August 1966, Moskvitch produced its
            100,000th M-408.</p>
            <p class="lead">The first series of cars were produced between 1964 and 1969 in Moscow. These automobiles had vertical rear lights, two
            or four round headlights, a front bench seat, and a 4-speed manual transmission with column mounted gear lever. The
            length of the standard model was 4,090 mm (161.0 in).</p>
            <p class="lead">The second series was produced between 1969 and 1976. It had the same engine and transmission as its predecessor, but an
            updated body fitted with rectangular headlights and horizontal rear lights, with triangular turn signal markers mounted
            on tailfins. Also it had separated bucket seats and the transmission used a floor-mounted gear lever.</p>
            <p class="lead">Between 1966 and 1967, the car was also produced by the IZh military factory in the city of Izhevsk, carrying the
            IZh-Moskvich-408 name â€” though usually called simply "IZh". This car was a rebadged version of the MZMA Moskvich-408.
            It was replaced in production with the IZh-412, a copy of the M-412, starting in 1967 and up to 1976.</p>
            <p class="lead">The car had modern features for 1964: squared-off body with flat roof panel and sharp tailfins, panoramic rear window
            and semi-panoramic windshield. Deluxe versions had then-fashionable quad headlights and (some series) two-tone paint.
            Since the layout of the first prototypes was created on the basis of the preceding M-407, the rear end design of the
            pre-facelift models inherited such characteristic features of the previous Moskvich series as tailfins decorated with
            chrome trims, narrow taillights, a recognisable trunk handle, and a fuel tank flap in the middle, behind the number
            plate.</p>
            <p class="lead">The M-408 was a conventional rear-wheel drive economy car powered by a 1357 cc OHV straight-four, producing 50 hp (37
            kW) at 4750 rpm (60.5 SAE hp). After 1967, the assembly of the engines was done by UZAM in Ufa. One two-barrel
            down-draft carburettor was used. The car was initially equipped with self-adjusting manual drum brakes, then from 1969
            with power brakes with a hydrovacuum servo and a split circuit braking system.</p>
            <p class="lead">This Moskvich was the first Soviet-built car to have deliberate safety equipment (since 1969): crumple zones, a safer
            steering column, a soft grip steering wheel cover, soft interior parts, seat belts, a padded dashboard, and a split
            circuit braking system.</p>

            <p class="lead">Adolf Hitler was searching for a people's car that was capable of transporting three children
              and two adults at speeds
              of sixty miles-per-hour. The car was to be inexpensive, costing the same as a motorcycle. Ferdinand Porsche
              was
              commissioned to produce such a vehicle.</p>
            <p class="lead">There are many theories as to where the designs originated from. Some believe Hitler designed
              the vehicle. Some theorize
              that it was Joseph Ganz's 1920 design that was the true inspiration for the Beetle design. Porsche had created
              designs
              for the Mercedes-Benz 170H, which played into the design of the Beetle.</p>
            <p class="lead">Inspiration for the Beetle had been drawn from the Tatra vehicles, mainly the T97, that had been
              designed by Hans
              Ledwinka. Due to the similarities, Tatra launched a lawsuit which never really materialized due to Germany
              invading
              Czechoslovakia. The lawsuit was later re-opened after World War II and Volkswagen was forced to pay Tatra
              3,000,000
              Deutsche Marks. This left Volkswagen with little money for development of new Beetle models.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Volkswagen Beetle first came on the scene in 1947, but they were known by a different name.
              KdF, short for Kraft
              durch Freude meaning 'power by joy', was designated to these small, gas-friendly vehicles. In English, the
              name Beetle
              was used. In German, they were known as Kafer, and in French they were called Coccinelle.</p>
            <p class="lead">These little bundles of joy featured mechanical drum brakes and a gearbox void of synchromesh.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">In 1949 the Volkswagen logo was placed on the rims. The engine was expanded to 1131 cc and was
              capable of producing 25
              horsepower. The models that were produced after October of 1949 could be started without a 'starting crank'.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Two convertible options were offered by Volkswagen in 1949. The two-seater design, designated
              14A, was penned by Josef
              Hebmuller. The four-seater Type 15 version was designed and produced by Karmann of Osnabruck. The four-seater
              was vastly
              more popular and stayed in production for 30 years.</p>
            <p class="lead">The 14A was stylish and attractive, with the major shortcoming being a fire that destroyed the
              factory where they were
              being produced. The two-seaters featured a rear deck nearly identical to the front hood. The strength of the
              car, lost
              by removing the roof, was amplified by a stronger windshield frame and dual Z-section girders located under
              the floor.
              In 1953, the last of the Hebmuller rolled off the assembly line, after only 696 examples were produced.</p>
            <p class="lead">In a time when practicality ruled over style, the four-seater cabriolet was king. The Karmann
              company had a long history
              of designing and building cars. In business since 1901, was familiar with assembly line production, benefits
              and
              features of different types of metals, and the styles of multiple markets.</p>
            <p class="lead">The mechanical, cable-driven brakes were replaced with hydraulic brakes in 1950.</p>
            <p class="lead">During the 1950's the Beetle saw exterior and interior improvements. 1951 saw the addition of
              arm-rests which were
              discontinued just a few months later. In 1952, 2nd-4th gears became synchronized. The dashboard was redesigned
              with a
              glove compartment. The rear of the Beetle was updated in 1953, receiving a new single oval pane window in
              place of its
              original split rear window design. In 1955, the bumper was improved and electrical direction-indicators were
              installed.
              A second tail-pipe was added. The front seats became wider and could be moved to three different seat-back
              adjustable
              positions.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1956, the tires became tubeless. Near the end of '56, side view mirrors became standard on
              all Beetle models.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1957 the front window was increased by 17 percent while the rear window received a 95 percent
              increase. A new
              dashboard, rear view mirror, radio, and a speaker appeared. The turn signals would now turn-off automatically.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Up to this point, a roller pedal had been used to initiate acceleration. This was the year that
              the gas pedal replaced
              the roller pedal.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1958, ivory disc wheels were offered.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1960, an engine capable of producing 34 horsepower was offered. The speedometer was increased
              from 74 mph to 87 mph.
              A windshield-wiper washer system became available. The front directional light was changed from white to
              amber.</p>
            <p class="lead">A gas gauge was added in July of 1961.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1963, the seats were changed from wool upholstery to synthetic. The VW emblem located on the
              hubcap was no longer
              painted. The safety of the vehicle was once-again enhanced with enlarged directional lights.</p>
            <p class="lead">There were minor changes in 1964. The windows did, however, become larger.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1965, the front axle was improved. The ongoing saga of incremental improvements received
              another chapter - A
              defroster vent was added to the center of the dashboard.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Beetle continued to be sold in the United States until 1978 with the convertible version
              sold until early 1980.
              Sales continued in Europe until 1985. Developing countries, such as Mexico, have been developing the Beetle
              since 1964
              and the vehicles have remained in production since that time.</p>
