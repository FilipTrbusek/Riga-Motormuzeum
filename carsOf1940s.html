            <p class="lead">The first Pobeda was developed in the Soviet Union under chief engineer Andrei A. Liphart. "Pobeda" means "victory"; and
            the name was chosen because the model's first tests were done in 1943 at Gorky Avto Zavod (GAZ, "Gorky Car Plant"), when
            victory in World War II began to seem likely. The plant was later heavily bombarded, but work was unaffected. The first
            prototype was ready on November 6, 1944, and after it gained approval the first production model rolled off the assembly
            line on June 21, 1946. The car was a successful export for the USSR, and the design was licensed to the Polish FSO
            factory in Warsaw, where it was built as the FSO Warszawa beginning in 1951. A few were assembled in Pyongyang, North
            Korea.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Pobeda has 2.1 litre sidevalve straight-4 engine producing 50 hp (37 kW) and top speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).</p>
            <p class="lead">The Pobeda was the first Soviet automobile to have turn signals, two electric wipers, an electric heater, and a built-in
            AM radio. The car came to be a symbol of postwar Soviet life and is today a popular collector's item. A total of 235,997
            Pobedas were produced including 14,220 cabriolets.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1949-53, 14,222 M-20s were built with 4-door convertible body (of 'cabrio coach' type), but sales were poor and the
            GAZ never returned to the idea of mass-producing a convertible.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1955-57, several thousands were built with a four-wheel drive system adapted from contemporary Soviet military
            vehicle (GAZ-69) for cross-country travel (designated GAZ-M-72). Russian references credit these as possibly being the
            first comfortable off-road vehicle with a closed unitized body.</p>

            <p class="lead">Pierre Jules Boulanger took charge of Citroën in 1935 and had the idea to create a car for social classes with low
            income. He wanted something simple and practical that could transport people and their goods on any terrain in an
            economical way.</p>

            <p class="lead">Boulanger wrote the specifications, mentioning he wanted "to make a car that can carry four people and 50kg of potatoes
            or a keg, at a maximum speed of 60 km/h, with a consumption of 3 litres per hundred kilometres and low maintenance
            costs."</p>
            <p class="lead">He enrolled André Lefebvre as engineer and Flaminio Bertoni, nicknamed "golden fingers", as stylist. The project was
            named TPV meaning 'very small car'.</p>
            <p class="lead">At first, a single-cylinder engine was considered before deciding on a twin-cylinder, air-cooled unit. The suspension
            used a torsion rod bundle, rubber blocks, vertical or horizontal springs and hydropneumatic. The start-up was performed,
            according to prototypes, by a crank and twine starter.</p>
            <p class="lead">On 2 September 1939, the first prototype was ready to be shown. Unfortunately, several days later, the Second World War
            was declared and the assembly line used for military equipment.</p>
            <p class="lead">Development continued in private. The air-cooled engine was chosen along with a 4-speed overdrive. The suspension
            combined lateral interaction and drummers for each wheel and the main brake links to the rear axle. The equipment
            becomes more practical with a second headlight, an electric starter and conventional seats.</p>
            <p class="lead">In October 1948, the first 2CV was presented at the Paris Motor Show. To begin with opinions were divided, but
            eventually it became the star of the show. Production started in June 1949 and named 2CV A, it's a real success. The
            press were full of praise on 2CV's ease of use and robustness. In 1951, a van version of the 2CV was launched, it
            weighed 250 kg with a 375 cm3 engine.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 1956, the AZL - "L" for luxury - was launched with a large rear window, a large soft top in synthetic fabric and
            trims with striped cloth seats. Ten years after its appearance, 2CV had a different look: a blue glacier colour, 380mm
            steering wheels and a new dashboard.</p>
            <p class="lead">In February 1989, the French production line stopped. With 5,114,940 2CV vehicles produced worldwide, 2CV is an iconic
            car and a symbol of joy!</p>

            <p class="lead">There is some confusion as to whether this car should be called REAF, RAF or REF. Well, there had been plans to start up
            car manufacturing in Riga straight after the war, but local politics were the cause of a long delay.</p>

            <p class="lead">However, in the
            summer of 1949 Stalin ordered that two automobile prototypes be built at the Riga Experimental Factory (REF) -
            originally established to manufacture radio loudspeakers, metal furniture and other useful articles, and be ready before
            the anniversary of the October Revolution.</p>
            <p class="lead">The team of designers under leadership of Engineering Captain Vsevolod Bahchivandzhi assembled the prototype using
            locally built parts, many of them still very experimental, including a hydro-mechanical transmission with automatic
            clutch. The car featured a modified GAZ-MM engine with two cylinders instead of four. The project was plagued by
            numerous setbacks, particularly in the transmission department. The only thing to reach Moscow by Stalin's deadline
            however, was a photograph of the car!</p>
            <p class="lead">The REF officials were not sent off to Siberia as they had feared, but were granted another year to get the prototype
            car finished. And so in the Autumn of 1950 two REAFs (that presumably stood for Riga Experimental Automobile Factory), a
            sedan and a convertible, made it all the way to Moscow.</p>
            <p class="lead">The cars underwent thorough testing in Moscow where a commission concluded that although the concept of a cheap,
            comfortable car was a good one, and praised the modern body design, the prototypes themselves left something to be
            desired. The expensive automatic transmission worked jerkily and the engine vibrated excessively and it seems the car
            was lacking shock absorbers altogether. Fuel consumption was about three times that of comparable Moskvich-401. To cap
            it all, the designers had failed to take car maintenance into account: if the engine needed repairing, the body first
            had to be removed. Not surprisingly the commission concluded that unless the design was fundamentally improved, the
            REAF-50 was not fit for manufacturing. And so ended a dream that cost over one million rubles.</p>
            <p class="lead">The sedan made it back to Riga and is now on display at the motor museum there. The cabriolet broke down en-route and
            was abandoned.
            Finally, RAF stands for the Riga Autobus Factory, where parts of the REAF-50 were manufactured, but apart from that and
            the similarity of the abbreviation, there is no connection between the two.</p>
